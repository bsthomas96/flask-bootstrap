        <h5 class="card-title">The Moon</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Moon is something in our universe that the average person does not think about daily. 
          But it plays a very significant role of the possibility of life on Earth. By moderating Earth's wobble on an axis, it makes our home planet more liveable. 
          The Moon affects Earth's climate, tides and altitude, and these play a critical role in the variety of weather we see around the world. 
          Without it we would have very unstable climate, ultimately leading to an unlivable planet! It is astonishing to know that it moves at a whopping 2,288 miles per hour,
          traveling apporximately 1,423,000 miles! At each second of the day, our Moon is somewhere working to keep our Earth as Earth! Go ahead!See where it is now!</p>
